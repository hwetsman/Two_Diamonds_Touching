Again, start in a quiet safe place. Of
course, with more practice you'll be able to
do this anywhere almost instantly with just
one breath but for now find a quiet place to
practice.

Identify what object it is outside of your
relationship that is attracting you. Another
person? A hobby? It can be anything.

Practice the emptiness meditation, using
your breath to accept and become
comfortable with the energy of longing for
what's attracting you. When you are
comfortable with the energy, ask yourself
what state of being the object of your desire
represents. Excitement? Security? An
acceptance of yourself? Let an image of this
object expressing this state form in your
mind.

If you can do this, imagine the other
person or thing having the state of being you
what, then that state is already inside you.
Like a seed waiting to be watered. We'll use
the energy taht longing gives us to water the
seed we want instead of the seed of
depression.

Use your in-breath to breathe in the
longing as you have been doing and as you
breathe out, breathe the energy directly to
the seed you wish to water. "Breathing in I 
am longing for (the object). Breathing out 
I'm feeling my (state of being)".

After a while you'll begin to feel the
fullness of this emotional quality which is
now yours. Sit for awhile and enjoy the
feeling of ahving this emotional quality as
your own. Look around. Is there someone to 
practice this new found gift with? For
instance, if what you were needing was
compassion, you have now watered the seed
of compassion in you. You can practice and
solidify your new habit of compassion for
yourself by showing compassion for
someone else.
