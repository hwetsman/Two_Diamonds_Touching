## Good-bye

Believe it or not, this book was originally
150 pages largely because I heard from
people who understandpublishing that I
can't sell a book shorter than that. When I
had it finished I realized that I had said the
same thing over and over to get that 150
pages. So I cut down to five. Friends who
read it convinced me I'd cut too much so here
it is fluffed up a little again.

I think the real reason books are no
shorter than 150 pages is that we need to
hear the same thing over and over agin. I'd
like us to be more honest about it. You'll
need to read this book ten to twenty times
and practice the meditations. Each time you
read it you'll be a different person reading in
a new way. So much better than the same
person reading 150 pages and getting bored.

I hope this book helps you as it has
others. May your life be filled with the
excitement of discovery in your journey with
your partner.
