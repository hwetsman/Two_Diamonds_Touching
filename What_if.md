## What if my Partner Won't...

What if my partner won't change? Won't
let go of old diamonds? Won't learn to
appreciate the ever changing me?

The truth is, we can only change ourself.
We can't change our partner. In most cases
in a relationship it is only one person who
changes at first, and , at first, that's enough.

If we decide to make a change in our life
and open ourself up to our partner, we're
doing it for ourself. the main effect is to
bring greater appreciation of our partner into
our life. A wonderful side effect is that we
give our partner a gift of a more loving,
wonderful person to love.

Sometimes people need time to get used
to a gift. It has to grow on them. At first, our
partner may be startled or even scared by
the change in us and may not respond in the 
way we want. This doesn't lower the value of
our gift. It's still just as precious.

The reaction of our partner (like all 
things) isn't permanent. Like ripples on
water, the fastest way to make it calm is to
leave it alone. trying to change the reaction
will only make more ripples. Have patience;
your partner will come around.
