Imagine you and your partner are both
beautiful multifaceted diamonds lying loosely
together in a rich velvet box. It's not a large
box, but there is room for the diamonds to
flip and roll, so that they can present their
faces to each other and touch in many
wonderful ways.

When we fall in love, it's like two
diamonds touching one facet of each to the
other. We imagine that this bond is strong
but brittle, that the only way to be with our 
partner is to be connected to this facet. The 
connection seems hard to break but once
broken, we think the diamonds will fall away
from each other.

Let's imagine a more gentle connection,
where the diamonds can rotate with each 
other touching lightly but always connected
by the excitement of a new facet. Imagine
each moment filled with the potential of a 
new aspect of our partner's life. When we see
our partner as he or she is, an endlessly
changing, exciting diamond, we find it hard
to wish for what lies outside the box.
