# Introduction

Many couples have sought my help in 
difficult times. In these pages is a little of 
what I've learned from them. If you've been
together for 50 hours or 50 years you will 
find something helpful here.

Even so, this small book has its limits. If
you are in a relationship where there is
physical violence, please don't try to use this
book. Instead, seek a safe place and then
seek professional help.

The experience of previous readers is 
that it is best to read this book in a quiet
place. You need not finish it in one sitting,
but should give yourself time to feel about
what you read.

My wish is that in this short book you
find the beginnings of a long joyous
relationship.
