## The Promise of Affairs

While we're waiting, we're vulnerable.
Like a crab shedding its shell, we're now able
to grow but for a while we're soft and easily
hurt. With our facets open and slightly raw,
this is also the time we are most vulnerable
to affairs.

What we most miss in ourselves shines
brightly in others. When that light dims in
our mate it's like the sun going down. We get
a little colder and become fascinated with the
light of distant stars. they call to us
beckoning us to leave the comfort of home
for the excitement of discovering new vistas.

That distant light shines from a single
facet, the facet we are most needing in 
ourselves, and as it turns out, the promises
held out by affairs are about as empty as the 
space between the stars
