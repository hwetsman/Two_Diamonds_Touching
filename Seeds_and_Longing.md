## Seeds and Longing

As we saw in the emptiness meditation
our longing is the energy underlying
whatever we were feeling. Wheather it was
anger, hurt, asdness, joy, peace or any other
feeling, it was the energy of our longing for
what we miss that causes this feeling to 
blossom.

Actually, blossum is a good word because
these feelings or states of being, are like
seeds. We can choose which seed to water
with the energy of our longing. Will we water
depression or joy? Fulfillment or anxiety?

This watering process is o old for us that
if feels automatic. We aren't even aware
we're doing it. And we're certainly not aware
that we can choose which seed to water
instead of our habitual seeds. The following 
meditation will help us be aware of our use of
our longing and teach us, with practice, to
decide which seed to water.
