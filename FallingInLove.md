# Falling In Love

We use the words falling in love to mean
the same thing as loving but they are not.
Falling in love is something we learned to do
very early. It doesn't take much skill to do it.
As in any kind of falling, we don't need much 
practice to do it well.

We see an object in our world, and right
away we understand that it has something
we need. If we had it we'd be whole, full.
Maybe a new puppy or the special Barbie
with the changing hair. And for a while we
are full. Our beloved is always with us and 
fills our every waking moment until we see
something else we need. 

Our first love can't fill that new need 
because it can't change. But we need 
something new because we have changed.
