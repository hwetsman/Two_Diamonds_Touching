## Acknowledgements

I've received help and love from many
people to make this book a reality. Together
they taught me that no thought I think is
realy my own, but rather arises from the
gifts I get from others. Thank you.

A few people deserve special mention.
My teacher and friend, Art Samuels, author
of Creative Grieving, who taught me how to
be happy after a loss. Thich Nhat Hanh, who
first explained to me through his work the
transient nature of any form including the 
form of energy we feel. Kathi Wyatt, J. B.
Anderson, and Jean Farmer-Calhoun for
reading the final draft. The staff at Vaqueros
restaurant in New Orleans who put up with
me at a foodless table while working on this
series of books. And finally, Ellie, for being
such a wonderful diamond.
