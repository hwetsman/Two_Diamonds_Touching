## The Consequences of Standing Still

We have many facets and by nature we
want them all appreciated, all touched so to 
speak. If we enter a relationship with another
person and see it as a static connection
between two unchanging facets, we're
committing to having all our other facets
untouched by our partner. None of us can
stand that for long. 

So, we meet up with other diamonds: job,
friends, hobbies, anything that can touch the 
other aspects of our lives. Eventually as our 
partner and we start to accumulate these 
other diamonds, they begin to bump into 
each other and put a strain on our original
bond.

As a consequence we might ask our
partner to give up some of their diamonds to
make room for our own. If they refuse, our
original bond with them may break. At this
point we feel trapped. The person we've
connected with has changed; we've changed.
What we now need and have to give doesn't
fit into an open facet of our partner. It begins
to sound hopeless and we look for a way out,
the only way to start over.

Instead, we may decide to learn to let go
of some of our other diamonds. We can
become free to rotate with our partner again.

Our feeling of wanting to start off fresh
with someone new is a correct one. However,
since both we and our partner are no longer
the people we were when we got together,
our partner can be that new person to help 
us start again. Hopefully you're reading 
this together, but if not it's important 
to realize that we can be the new person 
our partner wants. All it takes is
learning to live with some empty facets.
