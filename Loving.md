## Loving

Maturely loving is not something we did
early on and it isn't always easy. Loving
another for who they are and not just for
what we can get from them requires our
recognizing that we and the object of our
love are both ever changing. It is not the
other diamond that we are connected to or
committed to in love, it is the process of
staying in the box, the process of watching
and enjoying watever facet is turned to us
as our partner changes.
