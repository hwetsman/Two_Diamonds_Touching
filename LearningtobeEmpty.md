## Learning to be Empty

It's a given that we can't change anyone

isn't likely to give up comforting diamonds
so that we can keep our own. Similarly it's 
difficult for us to give up our extra diamonds
without hope that our partner will do the
same. Unfortunately, this may take a while, 
so we have to learn to live with the feeling of
some open facets until our partner can trust
us enough to count on us to be there. The
