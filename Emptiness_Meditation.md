## Emptiness Meditation

Start by finding a quiet safe place where 
you can be alone for a while. Later you'll be 
able to do this anywhere, anytime, but at first 
it's best to start in a quiet place.

As you sit or lie comofrtably notice your
breathing. Notice the senstaions in you
chest, mouth, and nose as you breathe out
and in. Relax and enjoy this for a while. As
you become comfortable with your breathing
begin to notice what else you're feeling.
Where in your body do you feel this empty
facet? What is the form of energy you feel in
response to this emptiness? Is it hurt, anger,
sadness, fear? Whatever it is, know that at a 
deep enough level all of these feelings
represent the same energy. This insight
allows you to change the form of the energy
while keeping the energy with which to help 
yourself.
  
With this knowledge use your in-breath to
accept the energy. "Breathing in I feel my..." 
and your out-breath to send love and
gratitude to that part of you most acutely
feeling the energy. "Breathing out I send you
love." You'll feel better in just a few minutes.
  
This is a powerful technique that helps us
to see the pain as a wonderful part of us.
When we practice this we feel better in just a 
few minutes. Freed from the acuteness of the 
pain we are now more able to accept and love
the longing in us. This longing is a beautiful
message telling us what we need. Later, we'll
learn how to get it.
